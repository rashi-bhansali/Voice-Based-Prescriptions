# Voice-Based-Prescriptions
Using Named Entity Recognition for chunking data (converted from speech to text by the google API) into fields like "tablet", "dosage", "duration", etc. in order to produce voice based prescriptions.
Another approach used here is CNN based multiclass classification applied on the text corpus retrieved from the API.
These models can be deployed on an application in the form of APIs that can be a valuable utility feature for doctors.
